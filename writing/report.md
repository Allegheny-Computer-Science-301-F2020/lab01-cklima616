### Article 1
 - Article name.
 - "TikTok Tracked User Data Using Tactic Banned by Google"

-  Reference or article citation.
 - [Article Link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-tracked-user-data-using-tactic-banned-by-google-11597176738)

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - The article outlines security concerns presented by the White House in regards
 to the parent company of TikTok, an increasingly popular social media platform.
 The company is accused of mining user MAC addresses, which can be used to
 track location and other user activity. The concern was over what this information
 was being used for, since the company is based in China. The app reported to have
 changed this in November of last year. MAC addresses were locked in Apple devices
 in 2013, and in Android devices in 2015. TikTok was under fire for working around
 Android devices specifically.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The primary concern outlined in the article was the apps strategy preventing
users from opting out of sharing this data with the company. MAC addresses are
unique in that they cannot be reset or changed in any way, so once the company
has access to this, there is nothing that can be done to limit their access
to the information that can be analyzed by it. ByteDance, the parent company,
also goes to extreme lengths to conceal this data and its usage.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - As stated previously, the data being collected and used is Android user's
 MAC addresses. These are unique network identifiers specific to each device.
 The address cannot be reset or changed.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - From the article and a brief Google search, the MAC address can be used to
 access user network information, which can yield information such as location,
 as well as cookies or other records of web usage. In addition, the use of this
 data is unknown due to the company's encryption of the data.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - The company gains information, which the White House and other experts have
 speculated to be used by the Chinese government. To put it simply, the user
 stands to lose security, and the company as well as the government could gain
 information for various manipulation purposes.


### Article 2
 -  Article name.
 - "7 Ways Amazon Uses Big Data to Stalk You"

-  Reference or article citation.
 - [Article Link](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/090716/7-ways-amazon-uses-big-data-stalk-you-amzn.asp)

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - The article outlines the mechanisms used by Amazon when analyzing buyer data,
 explaining the tactics that made them the giant of e-commerce.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The company uses copious amounts of user data to convince them to buy things.
 This poses ethical concerns because it manipulates consumers.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - The data being manipulated includes what you buy, what you put in your cart,
 the relationship between those data sets, and also the things you search for,
 and where you send orders. The location allows them to pre-stock in-demand
 items in places they are likely to be sold to cut delivery time. They also allow
 other companies to access this information through their cloud computing service.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - From what you search, they can recommend items similar to it. From what you
 have already purchases, they recommend things that are often bought with those
 items. They can also anticipate your price margin, and change prices according
 to demand often. The article says,

 > "Product prices typically change every 10 minutes as big data is updated and
 analyzed. As a result, Amazon typically offers discounts on best-selling items
 and earns larger profit margins on less-popular items."

 Amazon collects data and utilizes algorithms to promote impulse buys, and allows
 other websites and e-storefronts to utilize this information in similar ways.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - Consumers are less in control over the decisions they make due to companies
 like Amazon having more access to personal information. There is also very
 little transparency over when/what data is collected, or where it is being sold.
