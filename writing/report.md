### Article 1
 - Article name.
 - "TikTok Tracked User Data Using Tactic Banned by Google"

-  Reference or article citation.
 - [Article Link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-tracked-user-data-using-tactic-banned-by-google-11597176738)

- Briefly describe the article's premise.
 - The article outlines security concerns presented by the White House in regards
 to the parent company of TikTok, an increasingly popular social media platform.
 The company is accused of mining user MAC addresses, which can be used to
 track location and other user activity. The concern was over what this information
 was being used for, since the company is based in China. The app reported to have
 changed this in November of last year. MAC addresses were locked in Apple devices
 in 2013, and in Android devices in 2015. TikTok was under fire for working around
 Android devices specifically.

- What is the ethical concern, in your opinion?
 - The primary concern outlined in the article was the apps strategy preventing
users from opting out of sharing this data with the company. MAC addresses are
unique in that they cannot be reset or changed in any way, so once the company
has access to this, there is nothing that can be done to limit their access
to the information that can be analyzed by it. ByteDance, the parent company,
also goes to extreme lengths to conceal this data and its usage.

- What data is being manipulated in the article?
 - As stated previously, the data being collected and used is Android user's
 MAC addresses. These are unique network identifiers specific to each device.
 The address cannot be reset or changed.

- Briefly describe the analysis, as you understand it.
 - From the article and a brief Google search, the MAC address can be used to
 access user network information, which can yield information such as location,
 as well as cookies or other records of web usage. In addition, the use of this
 data is unknown due to the company's encryption of the data.

- Who stands to lose or to gain something from this form of analysis?
 - The company gains information, which the White House and other experts have
 speculated to be used by the Chinese government. To put it simply, the user
 stands to lose security, and the company as well as the government could gain
 information for various manipulation purposes.
